# React Template
## Created by Joe Bosman
This is a template that can be used to quickly get up and running with React. 

See the package.json file for a detailed list of the packages included. 

From a high level it is a simple server that provides a single html file with a bundle.js script. The bundle.js file must first be built using webpack. See the Getting Started section to build the bundle.js file and launch the template website.

## Getting Started
You must have Node and NPM installed.

Download the contents of the repo and execute the following commands.

```
npm install
npm run build dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to 'localhost:3000'.
